# Team 09 : Exercise 1 (Due 24.11.2025)
*All documents we mentioned can be found in branch "Exercise1".*

```
For Mass-Spring System, set m=k. 

Use different time-steps tau = {0.1, 0.05, 0.01} and much larger end-times T=8*pi.
```

## Exercise 17.2.2

### Q1 : Overall Process
1. Adapted the `Explicit_Euler.cpp` to get `explicit_euler.csv`. 
2. Adapted the `plotq1.py` to get performance plot `plot1_time_evolution.png` and `plot2_phase.png`.
3. Attention: Add .cpp path into `CMakeLists.txt` such that we can compile directly.

### Q1 : Plot 

#### Plot 1 : Time Evolution (explicit euler)
![Plot 1 : Time Evolution ](plot_ex1/plot1_time_evolution.png)

#### Plot 2 : Phase Plots (explicit euler)
![ Plot 2 : Phase Plots ](plot_ex1/plot2_phase.png)

### Q1 : Conclusion
- In time evolution plots, both x(t) and v(t) show increasing amplitude, and the growth becomes faster for larger time steps.
- In phase plots clearly illustrate this behavior: instead of forming closed circles (energy conservation), the trajectories spiral outward.
- Overall, explicit Euler is numerically unstable for this oscillatory system, and bigger step sizes make worse.

### Q2 : Overall Process
Similar with Q1, adapted `Improved_Euler.cpp` to get `improved_euler.csv`. Then adapted `plotq2.py` and get graph `plot3` and `plot4`.


### Q2 : Plot 

#### Plot 3 : Time Evolution (improved euler)

#### Plot 4 : Phase Plots (improved euler)
![ Plot 2 : Phase Plots ](plot_ex1/plot4.png)


### Comparison: Explicit Euler Method vs Improved Euler Method
- Obviously, the Improved Euler method shows significantly better stability and accuracy for the mass–spring system.

- For all three time steps, the time-evolution plots indicate that Improved Euler preserves both the amplitude and phase of the oscillation almost perfectly over long times. In contrast, Explicit Euler exhibits clear fluctuation.

- The phase plots further highlight this difference: Improved Euler produces closed circular trajectories that remain nearly identical for all tau, indicating near-conservation of energy. Explicit Euler, however, generates outward-spiraling curves whose radius increases with time, especially for larger tau.
