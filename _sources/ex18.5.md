## Exercise 18.5 

AutoDiff Pendulum

### Overall Process

1. Adapted the C++ file `ex18_5.cpp` to simulate the nonlinear pendulum using  

$$
\dot{\theta} = \omega,\qquad 
\dot{\omega} = -\frac{g}{L}\sin(\theta)
$$

with **AutoDiff-based Jacobian evaluation**.

2. Generated output trajectory file:  
   **`ex18_5.csv`**

3. Created Python scripts to plot:  
   - `pendulum_time.png` — Time evolution of θ(t) and ω(t)  
   - `pendulum_phase.png` — Phase portrait (θ vs ω)

---

### Plots

#### **Plot 1 – Time Evolution of Pendulum (Explicit Euler)**

![Time Evolution](plot_ex2/ex18_5_plot.png)

This plot shows the temporal evolution of the pendulum state variables:
- $\( \theta(t) \)$ : angular displacement  
- $\( \omega(t) \)$: angular velocity  

Euler integration introduces numerical energy growth over time.

#### **Plot 2 – Phase Plot (Explicit Euler)**

![Phase Plot](plot_ex2/phase_ex18_5.png)

This is the θ–ω phase portrait of the nonlinear pendulum.  
A true physical pendulum would trace closed orbits (constant energy), but explicit Euler causes energy to drift.

---

### Conclusion

- The explicit Euler method behaves **numerically unstable** for oscillatory systems like the pendulum.
- The **time evolution plot** shows that both  $ \theta(t) $ and $\omega(t)$ exhibit **increasing amplitude**, indicating energy gain.
- The **phase portrait** spirals outward instead of forming closed loops:
  - This means **energy is not conserved** numerically.
  - The trajectory grows unphysically over time.
- AutoDiff successfully computes Jacobians for the nonlinear pendulum model.
