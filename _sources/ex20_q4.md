## Q4: Experiment with different mechanical structures

### Model 1 : Extend the double-pendulum to a chain

*Complete code is in 'chain.ipnb'*

We only need to change the geometry part. Here we write a `for` loop to add mass and constraint.

```
for i in range(N_MASSES):
    initial_pos = (LINK_LENGTH * (i + 1), 0.0, 0.0)
    
    # add new mass
    current_mass_connector = mss.add(Mass(1, initial_pos)) 
    
    # add new constraint and connet it to the previous mass
    dc = DistanceConstraint(previous_connector, current_mass_connector, LINK_LENGTH)
    mss.addDistanceConstraint(dc)
    
    # refresh
    previous_connector = current_mass_connector

```

Such that everytime, we only need to change `N_MASSES`

```
N_MASSES = 5
LINK_LENGTH = 1.0
```

**Test 1**: When mass = 5

**Test 2**: When mass = 10

Reuslt: 
- With larger masses, the system begins to approximate a continuous body (such as a soft rope or a whip).

- The end mass resembling the tip of a whip, characterized by the propagation of waves and accelerated whipping motion.

- The hole system will turn slow, bulk oscillation, and faster, small-scale localized twisting and vibrational patterns emerging throughout the chain.
