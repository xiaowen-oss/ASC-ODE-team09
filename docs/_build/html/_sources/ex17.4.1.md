### Q1 : Overall Process
Adapted `Implicit_Euler.cpp` to get `implicit_euler.csv`. Then adapted `plotq2.1.py` and get graph `plot5` and `plot6`.

### Q2 : Overall Process
1. The general function of Crank-Nicolson method is:

```
 u_{n+1} - u_n - (tau/2)*(f(u_{n+1}) + f(u_n)) = 0
```

3. Adapted `Crank_Nicolson.cpp` to get `crank_nicolson.csv`. Then adapted `plotq2.2.py` and get graph `plot7` and `plot8`.

### Q3 : Comparison of the Four Time-Stepping Methods

Now we compare 4 methods in previously mentioned:

**Explicit Euler**

- The method is unstable for oscillatory systems.

- For moderate or even small time-steps, the numerical orbit in the phase plane spirals outward, corresponding to an artificial gain of energy.

- Larger time-steps lead to very rapid divergence.

**Improved Euler**

- Shows second-order accuracy and significantly better behavior.

- The phase curves stay close to a circle, even for larger time-steps.

- There is still a small drift, but the energy error remains bounded and does not grow dramatically like in Explicit Euler.

**Implicit Euler**

- Always stable, regardless of time-step size.

- However, the solution exhibits numerical damping: the phase orbit spirals inward, meaning the method artificially removes energy from the system.


**Crank–Nicolson**

- It is the one given the best results. Always stable, and energy-preserving method for linear oscillatory systems.

- The phase plots remain almost perfectly circular for all tested time-steps.

```
In General: 
For oscillatory systems -- the mass–spring model, Crank–Nicolson provides the most physically accurate long-time behavior, while Explicit Euler is the worst method.
