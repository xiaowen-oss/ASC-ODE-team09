# Exercise 3 (Due 09.12.2025)
*All documents we mentioned can be found in folder "Mechsystem".*

In this part, we solve problem:
- 20.4


We write many details to show results step by step (including codes). But in the report, just mention *main* thing.

For more complete codes, we have already uploaded in *mechsystem* folder. 

```
Basiclly, we have changed:
1. *mass_spring_hpp* -- add the constraints 
2. *bind_mass_spring.cpp* -- connect cpp with pybind
3. *Newmark.hpp* -- increase the tolerance and max iteration to get better result

```
